/*

Very simple vacuum cleaner agent in a world that has only four locations.

Perceptions:
. dirty: the current location has dirty
. clean: the current location is clean
. pos(X): the agent position is X (0 < X < 5).

Actions:
. suck: clean the current location
. left, right, up, down: move the agent

*/

// TODO: the code of the agent

// plans for a dirty location
+pos(1) : dirty <- suck; right.
+pos(2) : dirty <- suck; down.
+pos(3) : dirty <- suck; up.
+pos(4) : dirty <- suck; left.

// plans for other circumstances
+pos(1) : true <- right.
+pos(2) : true <- down.
+pos(3) : true <- up.
+pos(4) : true <- left.
